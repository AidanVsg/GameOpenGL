# Platformer in OpenGL
---
The platform game should enable the user to control (a) character(s) that move(s) on multiple platforms. 
- The following features are essential:
  - The game starts at ground level;
  - Has at least two levels above ground level;
  - Each level has to be made up of at least two distinct (separated) platforms unless interlaced levels (zigzag
from left to right) are used;
  - The target position of the platform has to be at the highest (or furthest) level;
  - The character(s) can jump from one level to the next both horizontally and vertically;
  - The character can collide with the platforms from all possible directions, i.e. it stays on the platform
(obviously) but can also hit its head when jumping upwards;
  - A clear objective and scoring system needs to be provided;
  - The world should be larger than the screen size which means the background (world) should scroll both
horizontally and vertically if the character(s) threaten to go off the screen out of the user’s view. 
- The following features are optional (but desirable):
  - The character is animated when walking or jumping (that is, use of different sprites/textures for
different motions);
  - NPC’s (non-player characters) try to stop the player’s character(s) from reaching its/their target;
  - The character (s) can eliminate NPC’s;
  - Have character offspring which follows a main character (e.g. SPROGS example);
  - Have moving (transition) platforms to travel from one fixed platform to another at the same (or even
adjacent) level(s).
  - Collision Response and physics
  - Special effects, dynamic textures, particle systems
  - More complex collision detection, e.g. GJK, BB hierarchies
  - More advanced AI for NPC’s
  - Gravity
  - More than one level
  - A level editor
  - Additional game information
